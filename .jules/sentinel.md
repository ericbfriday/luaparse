## 2024-05-20 - Prevent prototype pollution in dictionary objects
**Vulnerability:** Lua labels stored in plain objects (`{}`) allow prototype pollution via special keys like `__proto__`.
**Learning:** Dictionaries storing user-supplied string keys should not inherit from `Object.prototype` to avoid prototype pollution and logic bugs.
**Prevention:** Use `Object.create ? Object.create(null) : {}` to create prototype-less dictionaries with a fallback for older environments.
## 2024-05-20 - Prevent O(N^2) DoS in string parsing
**Vulnerability:** Parsing long string and comment terminators has an O(N^2) complexity because it iterates over the entire `level` length for every `]` character found without breaking on the first mismatch.
**Learning:** Inner loops matching string prefixes or delimiters must break early upon the first mismatched character to prevent Denial of Service (DoS) attacks via CPU exhaustion.
**Prevention:** Add early exit conditions (like `break`) inside string matching loops once a mismatch is detected.
