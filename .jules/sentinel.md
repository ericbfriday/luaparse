## 2024-05-20 - Prevent prototype pollution in dictionary objects
**Vulnerability:** Lua labels stored in plain objects (`{}`) allow prototype pollution via special keys like `__proto__`.
**Learning:** Dictionaries storing user-supplied string keys should not inherit from `Object.prototype` to avoid prototype pollution and logic bugs.
**Prevention:** Use `Object.create ? Object.create(null) : {}` to create prototype-less dictionaries with a fallback for older environments.
## 2024-05-20 - Prevent O(N^2) DoS in string parsing
**Vulnerability:** Parsing long string and comment terminators has an O(N^2) complexity because it iterates over the entire `level` length for every `]` character found without breaking on the first mismatch.
**Learning:** Inner loops matching string prefixes or delimiters must break early upon the first mismatched character to prevent Denial of Service (DoS) attacks via CPU exhaustion.
**Prevention:** Add early exit conditions (like `break`) inside string matching loops once a mismatch is detected.

## 2024-05-24 - Validate Input Types at API Boundaries
**Vulnerability:** The main `parse` function accepted non-string inputs (like objects/arrays) without validation, which caused unexpected internal type errors (e.g., `input.substr is not a function`) deep in the parser.
**Learning:** In dynamically typed environments, boundaries of APIs must coerce or validate inputs to their expected types. Unvalidated types can lead to unhandled exceptions, potential DOS vectors, or unpredictable behavior.
**Prevention:** Explicitly cast to or validate `String` types for inputs immediately inside public entry points before further processing.
## 2024-05-24 - Prevent Prototype Pollution in assign Polyfill
**Vulnerability:** The internal `assign` polyfill copies all properties from source objects to destination objects without checking for special keys like `__proto__`, `constructor`, or `prototype`. If untrusted configuration objects (e.g., `_options`) are passed, this can lead to prototype pollution.
**Learning:** Even internal utilities like `assign` must explicitly block modification of special prototype properties when copying properties from potentially untrusted user inputs.
**Prevention:** Add a check `if (prop === '__proto__' || prop === 'constructor' || prop === 'prototype') continue;` inside object assignment loops.
